# Setting up the VM
This repo will help you setup the VM

## Ubuntu

You can download an Ubuntu image here. Make sure to save it to a memorable location on your PC! For this tutorial, we will use the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/"> Ubuntu 20.04 release </a>. _Do not install it_.

## Virtual Box 7

In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through one of the easiest ways to try out Ubuntu Desktop on a virtual machine. VirtualBox is a general purpose virtualiser that is available across Linux, Mac OS and Windows. It’s a great way to experience Ubuntu regardless of your current operating system. Please download the virtual box for the operating system you are using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"> from here </a>.

Once you have completed the installation, go ahead and run VirtualBox.
